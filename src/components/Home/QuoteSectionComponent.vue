        What does the world think when Libya comes to mind?
      </h1>
      <p class="font-light mb-8 md:text-base text-lg">
        If you were to answer this question from an economic perspective, there
        is no doubt that oil is the answer that will come to your mind first,
        and everyone will understand that. Over the past decades, Libya has been
        dependent on the oil sector as a major economic resource, which has led
        to the neglect of investment in other areas. Old economic policies,
        which were adopted based on Socialism, created a workforce dependent on
        the public sector, which weakened the growth of the private sector.

      <p class="font-light mb-5 md:text-base text-lg">
        The world has changed since decades ago. The global economy witnessed
        great diversification with scientific and technological development. It
        also witnessed prosperity in the private sector. This meant that the
        policy of relying on the oil field and the public sector became
        unsustainable.
